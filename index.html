            <h1 >Introduction to HTML and CSS</h1>
            <p>
            HTML and CSS are the two fundamental technologies used to build and design web pages. 
            HTML provides the structure of the page, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, 
            images, and links. CSS, on the other hand, controls the appearance and layout of the content, 
            including colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual style.
             </p>
            <h2>What Is HTML?</h2>
            <p>
             HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. 
            It uses tags to define different parts of a website. For example, the 
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag creates a heading, while the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag 
            creates a paragraph. HTML is the backbone of every website on the internet.
            </p>

            <h2>What Is CSS?</h2>
            <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML content. It allows developers 
            to control the look and feel of a website, from simple color changes to complex 
            grid layouts and animations. CSS makes websites more visually appealing and easier 
            to navigate.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Are HTML and CSS Important?</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>They are essential for building modern websites.</li>
            <li>They form the foundation of web development.</li>
            <li>They work together to create both structure and design.</li>
            <li>They are easy to learn and widely used in the tech industry.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Best Resources to Learn HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>
                Learning HTML and CSS is the first step toward becoming a web developer.

            <h1>An Introduction to JavaScript</h1>

                <p>JavaScript is one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world. It is the primary language of the web and is responsible for making websites interactive, dynamic, and responsive. Whether you are clicking a button, opening a menu, or filling out a form online, JavaScript is working behind the scenes to make the experience smooth and engaging.</p>

                <h2>What Is JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language that runs directly in the browser. Unlike HTML and CSS—which create the structure and design—JavaScript adds behavior. It allows developers to update content, control multimedia, animate elements, and respond to user interactions in real time.</p>
                <p>For example, when a webpage updates without reloading, that is usually JavaScript at work.</p>

                <h2>Why Is JavaScript Important?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> It allows users to interact with the webpage through buttons, forms, sliders, and pop-up messages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time updates:</strong> Websites can display new data without refreshing, such as notifications or live chat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> All web browsers support JavaScript, making it universal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full-stack use:</strong> With technologies like Node.js, JavaScript can run on servers, allowing developers to use one language for both frontend and backend.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Key Features of JavaScript</h2>
